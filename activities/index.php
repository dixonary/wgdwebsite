        <h2>Workshops</h2>
        <p>
            Our weekly workshops run from 2-6pm in rooms across campus. This is a time to work on anything you want - some paper prototype, a private project, some game you're making as a team - and to get feedback
            and support from our friendly and inclusive community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Workshops are <b>drop-in</b> sessions - you can come and go whenever is convenient for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>NOTE: </b> Workshops are not held in computer rooms so <b>please bring a laptop</b> if you're doing computer work!<br>(We have power cords though)

        <h2>Talks</h2>

        <p>
            On Thursdays at 6pm, we often run talks - either from other WGD members with something to share, or from fantastic external indie and industry speakers.
            Content of talks will range across a wide variety of topics, from creativity and narrative design to technical skills and programming tricks.
        </p><p>
            Most talks will be accessible to all skill levels, so please do come along!
        </p><p>
        For more information about specific upcoming talks, 
            see posts on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/warwickgd/">facebook group</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/wgdsoc">twitter</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Showcases</h2>

        <p>
            During the Thursday talk slot we will sometimes run showcases. These are an opportunity for you to show off something you've been working on.
            All our talk rooms have projectors and speakers, but it can be something physical or interactive too.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no need to pre-commit - just bring something along on the day and show it off!

        <h2>Socials</h2>
        <p>
            Every now and again we get together and have a <b>local multiplayer gaming social</b>.
            This is mostly just an excuse to sit around and play Steam / console games for an evening (and to eat free pizza...)
        </p>
        <p> The time slots for socials vary but they are normally around the middle of term. Stay tuned to our social media for updates!</p>
