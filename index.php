<h2>Our commitments</h2>
<h4>To inclusivity</h4>
<div class="box code">
Our events are intended to be for everybody. We will not and do not tolerate any kind of harrassment or 
discriminatory language or actions against WGD members. Those found repeatedly engaging in such will be removed from our events.

<h4>To privacy</h4>

Sometimes we take photographs at our events. These may be shared online to help publicise the society.
When photos are being taken, everybody will be informed and has the opportunity to opt-out of being in them.
We will never use photos of you online without your consent.
